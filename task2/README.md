## TASK2 -
### Prediction using Unsupervised ML

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
### K-Means
K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

### Steps 

#### 1.IMPORTING REQUIRED LIBRARIES
#### 2. DETERMINING THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF CLUSTERS USING THE ELBOW METHOD
#### 3. CREATING THE KMEANS CLASSIFIER
#### 4. PLOTING THE CLUSTERS
#### 5. Adding the prediction to the dataset
#### 6. DATA VISUALISATION using different graphs
